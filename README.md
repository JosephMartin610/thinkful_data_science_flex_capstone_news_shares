# Supervised Learning Capstone Project: Predicting Popularity of Mashable News Articles

**Project Description**

- Developed supervised learning models to predict the popularity of Mashable news articles by using a large number of article properties as the features and a binary class split for the number of social media shares as the target outcome.
- Compared performance of four model types: logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and kernel support vector machine.
-	Built models using Python, pandas, and scikit-learn in a Jupyter notebook.

**Source Data**

The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yamqwe/predicting-number-of-shares-of-news-articles), but originally comes from this research project:
- Fernandes et al., 2015. A Proactive Intelligent Decision Support System for Predicting the Popularity of Online News [[PDF](https://github.com/JosephMartin610/thinkful_data_science_flex_capstone_news_shares/blob/main/Fernandes_et_al_2015.pdf)].
- The research article was consulted for information about the dataset.
- The dataset was created by retrieving content of all articles published on Mashable from January 7, 2013 to January 7, 2015.
- There are numerous potential features available, which are categorized as shown in this [table](https://github.com/JosephMartin610/thinkful_data_science_flex_capstone_news_shares/blob/main/feature_categories.png) from the research article. 

The data file is availble [here](https://github.com/JosephMartin610/thinkful_data_science_flex_data_files/blob/main/OnlineNewsPopularity.csv) in another repository. The information file is available [here](https://github.com/JosephMartin610/thinkful_data_science_flex_capstone_news_shares/blob/main/OnlineNewsPopularity.names).

**Jupyter Notebook**

All of the code and results are in one Jupypter notebook, [supervised_learning_capstone_classification.ipynb](https://github.com/JosephMartin610/thinkful_data_science_flex_capstone_news_shares/blob/main/supervised_learning_capstone_classification.ipynb).

**Presentation**

The development and performance of the models are described here in the capstone [presentation](https://github.com/JosephMartin610/thinkful_data_science_flex_capstone_news_shares/blob/main/supervised_learning_capstone.pdf).
